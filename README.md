## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Spoify-Karaoke2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Create App"
3. Fill in the app details:
   - **App name**: Spotify Karaoke (or any name you prefer)
   - **App description**: Display Spotify lyrics in karaoke style
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify`
4. Save your app and note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 4. Set Up Genius API (for lyrics)

1. Go to [Genius API Clients](https://genius.com/api-clients)
2. Sign in or create a Genius account
3. Click "New API Client"
4. Fill in the app details:
   - **App Name**: Spotify Karaoke
   - **App Website URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (or your website)
5. Once created, click "Generate Access Token"
6. Copy your **Access Token** (you'll need this for the next step)

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your credentials:
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_genius_access_token_here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
   ```

3. Generate a random secret for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Click "Login with Spotify" on the home page
2. Authorize the application to access your Spotify playback
3. Play any song on your Spotify account (phone, desktop, web player, etc.)
4. Watch the lyrics appear in karaoke style on the screen!

## How It Works

- The app polls Spotify's API every 3 seconds to check what's currently playing
- When a new song is detected, it fetches the lyrics from Genius API
- Lyrics are automatically split into timed segments based on song duration
- Lyrics are displayed in sync with the song's playback position
- The current line is highlighted in large yellow text
- Previous lines fade out while upcoming lines appear in gray

## Lyrics Integration

This application uses the **Genius API** to fetch lyrics for songs playing on Spotify. The lyrics are automatically synchronized with the playback timeline by evenly distributing them across the song's duration.

**Note:** If a song's lyrics aren't found on Genius, the app will display placeholder lyrics as a fallback.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework

## Deployment

To deploy to production:

1. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` in your environment variables to your production URL
2. Add the production callback URL to your Spotify app settings (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/spotify`)
3. Update your Genius API client with the production URL
4. Add all environment variables to your hosting platform
5. Deploy to your preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
